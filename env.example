I once was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in
And then a little light from heaven fill my soul
He bathed my heart in love and He wrote my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus makes me whole

Have a little talk with Jesus
(Let us) tell Him all about our troubles
(He will) hear our faintest cry
(And He will) answer by and by
(And now when you) feel a little prayer wheel turnin'
(Lord, you know) know a little fire is burnin'
(You will) find a little talk with Jesus makes it right

Well, I may have doubts and fears
My eyes be filled with tears
Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
I go to Him in prayer
He knows my every care
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right

Have a little talk with Jesus
(Let us) tell Him all about our troubles
(He will) hear our faintest cry
(And He will) answer by and by
(And now when you) feel a little prayer wheel turnin'
(Lord, you know) know a little fire is burnin'
(You will) find a little talk with Jesus makes it right

Have a little talk with Jesus
(Let us) tell Him all about our troubles
(He will) hear our faintest cry
(And He will) answer by and by
(And now when you) feel a little prayer wheel turnin'
(Lord, you know) know a little fire is burnin'
(You will) find a little talk with Jesus
Have a little talk with Jesus (well)
Just a little talk with Jesus makes it right

Have a little talk with Jesus
(Let us) tell Him all about our troubles
(He will) hear our faintest cry
(And He will) answer by and by
(And now when you) feel a little prayer wheel turnin'
(Lord, you know) know a little fire is burnin'
(You will) find a little talk with Jesus
Have a little talk with Jesus (I say)
Just a little talk with Jesus makes it right
